Dear Recruiter,

My name is Leke Peter Abiodun, I have experience building complex web applications ranging
from School Management System to Human Resources Management, Job Portal, etc.

As a developer, building easy-to-use, user-friendly websites following requirements and
specifications while building web applications, and taking up new challenges are truly a passion
of mine and I am confident I would be an excellent choice for this job.

I believe I can add tremendous value, with my unique blend of skills and passion, coupled with
3+years of hands-on experience building web apps using PHP/Laravel and other technology in
the Laravel ecosystem which includes Livewire, AlpineJs, TailwindCSS.

In addition, my background in Computer Science with working in a development team has given
me the skills to adjust to the changing dynamics and processes of those environments while
meeting scheduled milestones and deliverables.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet you and further discuss the requirements in
detail. Thank you for your consideration, I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Best regards,

Leke Peter Abiodun.
